<h2> Case Study: Driving Digital Transformation and Enhancing Customer Experience at Bredband2</h2>

<h3>Introduction: </h3>

<p>During my tenure as a full-stack developer at Bredband2, a leading telecommunications company, I had the opportunity to contribute to various critical projects that significantly impacted the organization's digital presence, security measures, and overall customer experience. In this case study, I will highlight three key initiatives that exemplify my skills, dedication, and problem-solving abilities. </p>

<br />
<h3>Project 1: Redesigning the Digital Identity </h3>

<p>One of the most significant projects during my tenure at Bredband2 was leading two major platform migrations while simultaneously redesigning the website's visual identity. This multi-phase initiative spanned several years and required careful planning, technical expertise, and strong collaboration across teams.</p>

<h4>Phase 1: WordPress to Gatsby.js Migration</h4>

<p>The original setup consisted of two separate systems: a WordPress website and a legacy PHP site for the e-commerce shop. The primary goal of this migration was to consolidate everything into a single, modern platform. As the technical lead, I planned and executed the complete migration to Gatsby.js, unifying the shop and website into one cohesive system. This involved:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Merging two separate platforms (WordPress site and legacy PHP shop) into a single Gatsby.js application</li>
    <li>Developing new backend APIs in Ruby on Rails to power the e-commerce functionality</li>
    <li>Extracting years of blog posts and content from WordPress and migrating them to Contentful, a headless CMS</li>
    <li>Implementing GraphQL queries in Gatsby to efficiently fetch and display content on the frontend</li>
    <li>Converting the existing SASS CSS framework to work within Gatsby's architecture</li>
    <li>Cleaning up WordPress-specific CSS and refactoring styles for better maintainability</li>
    <li>Leading the planning process and guiding team members through the migration</li>
</ul>

<h4>Phase 2: Gatsby to Next.js Migration</h4>

<p>After two years on Gatsby, we migrated the entire site to Next.js to take advantage of its server-side rendering capabilities and improved performance. Once again, I led the planning and execution of this migration, ensuring a smooth transition while minimizing disruption to users.</p>

<h4>UX and Product Development</h4>

<p>Throughout both migrations, I worked closely with our UX designer to create new landing pages for product launches and enhance the overall user experience. A major focus was improving the search functionality and e-commerce journey for ordering new broadband services. This included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Developing separate search experiences for private and corporate broadband offerings</li>
    <li>Creating a streamlined e-commerce flow used by multiple customer personas</li>
    <li>Ensuring WCAG compliance throughout the redesign, working with Rebecca Löfgren, a senior UX expert, to bridge the gap between design and implementation</li>
    <li>Delivering a visually modern, accessible, and user-centric website that elevated Bredband2's brand perception</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h3> Project 2: Development of "Mitt Bredband2" Customer Portal </h3>

<p>During my time at Bredband2, I played a crucial role in the development of "Mitt Bredband2," a customer portal that provided users with secure access to personalized account information and services. This customer portal allowed users to log in using bankID or their username and password. By providing a comprehensive self-service platform, users could view account details, manage services, and engage in real-time chats as logged-in customers.</p>

<p>The implementation of the customer portal had a significant impact on Bredband2's operations. By empowering users to handle account-related tasks independently, we observed a decrease in calls to the service center, leading to cost savings for the organization. Additionally, I spearheaded the implementation of a feature that enabled users to easily upgrade or downgrade their services directly from the customer portal, reducing the reliance on customer service interventions.</p>

<br />

<h3>Project 3: Implementing Advanced Search with Algolia and Contentful API</h3>

<p>Another major initiative I spearheaded at Bredband2 was the implementation of a robust search functionality across the website and customer portal, utilizing Algolia Search, Contentful API, and InstantSearch. This project aimed to improve information retrieval, enabling users to find content quickly and intuitively. </p> <p>Working as the lead developer, I integrated Algolia's powerful search engine with Contentful, the company’s CMS, to create a seamless and efficient search experience. By leveraging InstantSearch, I implemented advanced search features, including:</p> <ul> <li>Real-time search results and filtering based on user input.</li> <li>Autocomplete suggestions to guide users toward relevant content faster.</li> <li>Dynamic ranking algorithms, ensuring the most relevant results appeared first.</li> </ul> <p>The search implementation significantly enhanced the user experience by enabling users to navigate Bredband2’s extensive content library and quickly find solutions to their queries. Furthermore, it streamlined the website’s usability, reduced bounce rates, and contributed to a measurable improvement in customer satisfaction metrics.</p>

<h3>Professional Growth and Accomplishments:</h3>

<p> Throughout my journey at Bredband2, I continually pursued personal and professional development, acquiring new skills and certifications to enhance my capabilities as a versatile developer. Some noteworthy achievements during my time include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Proficiency in Ruby on Rails: I gained expertise in developing web applications using Ruby on Rails, enabling efficient and scalable solutions for Bredband2's platform.</li>
    <li>Cloudflare Pages: I expanded my knowledge and hands-on experience with Cloudflare Pages, harnessing its capabilities to optimize website performance and security. </li>
    <li>Certifications: I pursued Google Analytics and UX certifications, validating my expertise in data-driven decision-making and user-centric design principles.</li>
    <li>Self-Leadership Course: I successfully completed a self-leadership course, enhancing my ability to manage projects, collaborate effectively, and drive results in a dynamic environment.</li>
    <li>TypeScript Familiarity: I delved into TypeScript, augmenting my understanding of this statically typed superset of JavaScript, which facilitated the development of more robust and scalable code.</li>
    <li>Docker Troubleshooting: Overcoming various challenges with Docker, I honed my troubleshooting skills and adopted Orbstack for streamlined management of machines and containers.</li>
    <li>GitHub Action Development: I created a custom GitHub Action that automates checks on pull requests, providing an overview of repository size, linking to relevant issues, and displaying various checks' status.</li>
    <li>Introduction to Cybersecurity: I earned my first Cisco certificate, specifically Introduction to Cybersecurity, broadening my knowledge of information security principles and practices.</li>

</ul>
<br />
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

My time at Bredband2 was characterized by my dedication to driving digital transformation, enhancing security measures, and improving the overall customer experience.
