<h3> Project 2: Development of "Mitt Bredband2" Customer Portal </h3>

<p>During my time at Bredband2, I played a crucial role in the development of "Mitt Bredband2," a customer portal that provided users with secure access to personalized account information and services. This customer portal allowed users to log in using bankID or their username and password. By providing a comprehensive self-service platform, users could view account details, manage services, and engage in real-time chats as logged-in customers.</p>

<p>The implementation of the customer portal had a significant impact on Bredband2's operations. By empowering users to handle account-related tasks independently, we observed a decrease in calls to the service center, leading to cost savings for the organization. Additionally, I spearheaded the implementation of a feature that enabled users to easily upgrade or downgrade their services directly from the customer portal, reducing the reliance on customer service interventions.</p>
