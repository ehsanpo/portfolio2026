<h3>Project 1: Redesigning the Digital Identity </h3>

<p>One of the most significant projects during my tenure at Bredband2 was leading two major platform migrations while simultaneously redesigning the website's visual identity. This multi-phase initiative spanned several years and required careful planning, technical expertise, and strong collaboration across teams.</p>

<h4>Phase 1: WordPress to Gatsby.js Migration</h4>

<p>The original setup consisted of two separate systems: a WordPress website and a legacy PHP site for the e-commerce shop. The primary goal of this migration was to consolidate everything into a single, modern platform. As the technical lead, I planned and executed the complete migration to Gatsby.js, unifying the shop and website into one cohesive system. This involved:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Merging two separate platforms (WordPress site and legacy PHP shop) into a single Gatsby.js application</li>
    <li>Developing new backend APIs in Ruby on Rails to power the e-commerce functionality</li>
    <li>Extracting years of blog posts and content from WordPress and migrating them to Contentful, a headless CMS</li>
    <li>Implementing GraphQL queries in Gatsby to efficiently fetch and display content on the frontend</li>
    <li>Converting the existing SASS CSS framework to work within Gatsby's architecture</li>
    <li>Cleaning up WordPress-specific CSS and refactoring styles for better maintainability</li>
    <li>Leading the planning process and guiding team members through the migration</li>
</ul>

<h4>Phase 2: Gatsby to Next.js Migration</h4>

<p>After two years on Gatsby, we migrated the entire site to Next.js to take advantage of its server-side rendering capabilities and improved performance. Once again, I led the planning and execution of this migration, ensuring a smooth transition while minimizing disruption to users.</p>

<h4>UX and Product Development</h4>

<p>Throughout both migrations, I worked closely with our UX designer to create new landing pages for product launches and enhance the overall user experience. A major focus was improving the search functionality and e-commerce journey for ordering new broadband services. This included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Developing separate search experiences for private and corporate broadband offerings</li>
    <li>Creating a streamlined e-commerce flow used by multiple customer personas</li>
    <li>Ensuring WCAG compliance throughout the redesign, working with Rebecca Löfgren, a senior UX expert, to bridge the gap between design and implementation</li>
    <li>Delivering a visually modern, accessible, and user-centric website that elevated Bredband2's brand perception</li>
</ul>
