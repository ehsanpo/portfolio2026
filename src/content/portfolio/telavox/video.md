### Project 4: Video Conferencing Integration

This project began with our team member architecting the backend infrastructure for video conferencing. After six months of development by a consulting firm that added core features, I joined to finalize and productize the solution.

#### **My Role:**

I took ownership of transforming the existing codebase into a production-ready product integrated into our main application. This involved:

- Analyzing and understanding code written by multiple developers with different approaches
- Removing debugging code and development artifacts to prepare for production
- Implementing proper naming conventions, color schemes, and UI consistency
- Building the complete chat functionality for video calls
- Integrating the video conferencing feature seamlessly into the existing application
- Ensuring the product met quality standards for end-user release

#### **Key Features:**

- **Real-Time Chat:** Built a complete chat interface for text communication during video calls
- **Adaptive Video Quality:** The platform adjusts video quality based on network conditions for optimal performance

#### **Technical Stack:**

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Mediasoup (WebRTC-based conferencing with SFU architecture)
- **Custom JS SDK** for frontend-backend communication

#### **Challenges:**

The main challenge was inheriting a codebase developed by different teams and turning it into a polished, production-ready product. This required deep code analysis, refactoring for consistency, and building new features while maintaining compatibility with the existing architecture. Successfully integrating video conferencing into our application gave users a complete communication solution within a single platform.
