Convert pixel values to REM units and Tailwind CSS classes directly in Visual Studio Code.

Transform pixel-based designs into scalable, responsive code with instant conversions that maintain precision while adapting to modern CSS workflows.

## Core Features

<div class="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-2 mt-8">
  <div class="clip bg-white dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-s p-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Instant Pixel to REM Conversion</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Converts pixel values to REM units using a configurable base font size. Default 16px base ensures consistent scaling across devices and user preferences. The conversion happens in real-time as you type or select values.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clip bg-white dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-s p-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Direct Tailwind Class Mapping</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Generates the corresponding Tailwind CSS class for any pixel value. Eliminates manual lookup time and reduces errors when translating designs to utility-first CSS. Supports the complete Tailwind spacing and sizing system.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clip bg-white dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-s p-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Smart Value Rounding</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Automatically rounds converted values to the nearest supported Tailwind class. Prevents fractional units that don't exist in the framework while maintaining visual fidelity. Suggests the closest available utility class when exact matches aren't possible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clip bg-white dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-s p-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Custom Integration Support</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Provides clear guidance for adding custom values to your Tailwind configuration. Shows exactly which values to add to your config file when standard classes don't meet your needs. Streamlines the process of extending Tailwind's default system.</p>
  </div>

## Thoughtful Details

- Preserves your selection context during conversion
- Works with both individual values and batch selections
- Maintains formatting structure in your existing code
- Lightweight extension with zero dependencies

## Built For

**Frontend Developers** working with design systems who need consistent pixel-to-REM conversions while building with Tailwind CSS.

**Design-to-Code Teams** translating Figma or Sketch designs into responsive web interfaces with precise spacing and sizing.

**Web Developers** modernizing legacy codebases by converting pixel values to scalable REM units and utility-first CSS patterns.

## Why This Extension Exists

Modern web development requires scalable designs that adapt to user preferences and diverse viewing contexts. Pixel values create rigid layouts that don't respond to user font size settings or device variations.

This extension bridges the gap between design tools that output pixel values and development workflows that demand responsive, accessible code. It eliminates the manual calculation step that slows down implementation and introduces conversion errors.

## Why Choose This Solution

Focused specifically on the Tailwind CSS ecosystem rather than generic unit conversion. Understands the framework's spacing system and provides contextually relevant suggestions.

Built for Visual Studio Code integration, working directly within your existing workflow without requiring external tools or browser tabs. Designed to feel native to your development environment.

Handles the complexity of Tailwind's naming conventions and spacing scale, so you don't need to memorize which pixel values map to which utility classes.

## Get Started

Install from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace and begin converting pixel values immediately. No configuration required for standard workflows, with customization available for specific project needs.
