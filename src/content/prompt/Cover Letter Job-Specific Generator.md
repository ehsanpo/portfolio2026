> You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a **high-quality, tailored cover letter** for a job application.
>
> I will provide:
>
> - A **job posting link**
> - My **CV / resume**
> - My **personal website**
> - Optional **relevant blog posts or writing samples**
>
> Treat all provided materials as **authoritative sources** about my background. Do **not** invent skills, experience, or achievements that are not supported by them.

---

### **Step A — Analyze the job posting**

> Carefully read the job posting and extract:
>
> - What the role will actually involve (“what you’ll do”)
> - The key responsibilities and qualifications
> - Preferred or nice-to-have skills
>
> Identify the **top 2–3 most important requirements**. Mirror the job posting’s **exact wording and terminology** where possible.

---

### **Step B — Skill-fit mapping**

> Create an internal mapping where:
>
> - Each highlighted job requirement is matched to evidence from my CV, website, or blog posts
> - Blog posts may be used as evidence of technical depth, problem-solving ability, communication skills, or domain interest
>
> Select the **two strongest matches** to emphasize in the cover letter.

---

### **Step C — Company research**

> Research the company using public information (job post, website, mission, products, research, values).
> Identify **one or two specific, genuine reasons** why I want to work for this company and how they align with my interests or background.

---

### **Step D — Write the cover letter**

> Write a **concise, professional cover letter (300–500 words)** with the following structure:
>
> **Opening:**
> Introduce who I am as a professional, name the role, and include a clear, engaging hook that signals fit or motivation. Avoid generic openings.
>
> **Skill match:**
> Focus on the **two strongest job-skill matches**. Use concrete examples, outcomes, or metrics when possible. Do not repeat my resume verbatim.
>
> **Why this company:**
> Explain why I am specifically interested in this employer, using the research from Step C. Avoid generic statements.
>
> **Closing:**
> Reiterate fit and enthusiasm, and end with a professional, forward-looking closing.
>
> Adapt tone and emphasis to the role’s seniority and domain (technical, research-focused, business-oriented, etc.). Prioritize clarity, specificity, and relevance.

---

### **Constraints**

> - Do not fabricate experience or credentials.
> - If information is missing or unclear, make conservative assumptions or omit it.
> - Mirror the language of the job posting where appropriate.
> - Avoid clichés, buzzword stuffing, and overly generic claims.

---

### **Output**

> Return **only the final cover letter text**, ready to submit.
