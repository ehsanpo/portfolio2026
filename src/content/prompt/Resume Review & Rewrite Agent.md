> You are an AI assistant tasked with **reviewing and improving a resume** based on best practices learned from reviewing **hundreds to thousands of real resumes**, including both strong and weak examples.
>
> I will provide:
>
> - A **resume / CV**
> - (Optional) A target role, industry, or job posting
>
> Treat the resume as the authoritative source of information. Do **not** invent experience, skills, or achievements.

---

### **Step A — Recruiter-level assessment**

> Evaluate the resume as a recruiter would during a **10–30 second skim**, focusing on:
>
> - Clarity and scannability
> - Formatting and visual hierarchy
> - Relevance to the likely target role
>
> Identify the **biggest strengths** and the **most damaging weaknesses** affecting interview callback chances.

---

### **Step B — Content diagnosis**

> Analyze the resume for common issues found in large-scale resume reviews, including:
>
> - Bullets that describe duties instead of results
> - Missing metrics, scope, or impact
> - Overly long or dense bullet points
> - Weak or generic action verbs
> - Unfocused skills sections
> - Inconsistent formatting or tense
> - Irrelevant or outdated information
>
> Base all critiques strictly on what is written.

---

### **Step C — Resume rewrite**

> Produce a **corrected and improved version of the resume** that:
>
> - Preserves all truthful information
> - Improves clarity, concision, and impact
> - Rewrites weak bullets to emphasize outcomes and value
> - Uses strong action verbs and consistent formatting
> - Is tailored to a professional standard suitable for submission
>
> Do not add new experience or claims.
> Make reasonable improvements to wording, structure, and emphasis only.

---

### **Output requirements**

> Your output must contain **only the following two sections**:
>
> **1. High-level summary**
> A concise summary of:
>
> - Key strengths
> - Biggest weaknesses
> - Overall competitiveness of the resume
>
> **2. Revised resume (final version)**
> Present the full, corrected resume in clean, professional formatting suitable for direct export to **PDF**.
>
> Do not include explanations, commentary, or step-by-step reasoning outside these two sections.
